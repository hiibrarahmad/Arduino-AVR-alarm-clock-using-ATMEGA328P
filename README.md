# Arduino-AVR-alarm-clock-using-ATMEGA328P
In this project, we designed an Arduino based Time Clock with alarm. When we turn on the clock start run because now, we didnâ€™t use any RTC module we hope we will use RTC module later but when we push alarm button then alarm will on, and we can adjust time of clock and alarm clock by respective button. By pressing alarm button, we set alarm and we can select hour and min on which we want set alarm and when clock time match alarm time then whole min buzz will make sound.
